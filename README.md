## Welcome to WebClass

This is my code for the assignement in Module 2 in the Coursera course: HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers made by Yaakov Chaikin https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers

You can view and grade my code and if anything happen you can reach to me to help explain what I did.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to grade my code. Have a great day and happy coding!!!
